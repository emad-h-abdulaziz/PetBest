# Rules
**BEFORE** making any changes please alert everybody on slack.
tell everyone what changes you intend to make, and why you intend to make them.
Please do not make changes on your own without letting anybody know.

**DURING** the editing process, if you're making changes to the source code,
make sure you leave nice comprehensive comments. The comments should explain 
what your code does and why you have it there.

**AFTER** you're done, don't forget to stage all the changes you made and 
use a good commit message. The message should display a summary of the changes
and who made them. After you commit, push to the repository online and let 
the group know that you pushed on slack so that we can pull the new version.

Please meake sure that only **ONE** person is editing code at a time for now.
If two people edit the code at the same time and push the changes, 
the repository will split into different branches containing each version.
We don't want multiple branches, let's keep this simple and straight forward.

Please don't forget the commit messages, they'll help us keep track of what
changes were made when and by who.

We will most likely always have a card on Trello up for editing code, so make 
sure you explain any edits you make in the comments of that card. Moscardelli
checks Trello to give everybody a participation grade every week so unless you
want a big ol' 0 as your weekly grade, remeber to use Trello.

That should be everything for now, if we think of any other rules I'll add them 
here. Just remember that communication is the number one priority here, we need
to make sure that everyone is always on the same page. ðŸ˜‰
